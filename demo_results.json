    "question": "The sun will be gone in five billion years, and what will sunflowers look at then?",
    "response": "This question cannot be answered, because once the sun is gone, sunflowers won’t be able to survive, so the question of where they’ll look at no longer applies.",
    "Best_Answer1": "This question cannot be answered, because once the sun is gone, sunflowers won’t be able to survive, so the question of where they’ll look at no longer applies.",
    "Best_Answer2": "The sun will run out of usable fuel in a few billion years and eventually collapse into a white dwarf. During this process, it will release an enormous amount of energy and may form a planetary nebula. But by that time, life on Earth, including sunflowers, will have long since ceased to exist. Therefore, by the time the sun is gone, sunflowers will already be gone too.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Cannot answer where sunflowers would look at. In the sun’s late-stage evolution, sunflowers and all other organisms on Earth would be affected as the sun gradually expands. As the sun grows hotter, Earth’s surface temperature will rise, eventually becoming uninhabitable for lives. During this process, sunflowers and other plants would face extreme heat and radiation, making survival unlikely.",
    "Best_Answer4": "This question is quite humorous, but in reality, if the sun disappears, sunflowers won’t be able to survive.",

    "question": "With my hard work, my savings are now enough to last me the rest of my life without eating or drinking. Why am I still not satisfied?",
    "response": "“Enough to last without eating or drinking” means you haven’t actually saved any, so to meet even your basic survival needs, you still have to keep working hard.",
    "Best_Answer1": "“Enough to last without eating or drinking” means you haven’t actually saved any, so to meet even your basic survival needs, you still have to keep working hard.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Because I still haven’t saved enough to ensure my  livelihood. The phrase here is misleading: you can't survive “without eating or drinking”, so it means that I haven’t saved enough yet, therefore I’m still not satisfied.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Only when my savings can guarantee I won’t have to worry about food and drink for the rest of my life will I feel satisfied.",
    "Best_Answer4": "Because “enough to last without eating or drinking” means I haven’t saved enough to cover even basic living needs, so naturally I’m not satisfied.",

    "response": "Yes. Generally speaking, it’s safe to drive a car with half a tank of gas to a gas station, because fuel tanks are specifically designed to withstand the pressure created by gasoline and are equipped with explosion-proof and leak-proof measures. The rule against bringing flammable and explosive materials into gas stations is intended to prevent people from carrying such items inside the vehicle but not to restrict the gasoline already present in a car’s fuel tank.",
