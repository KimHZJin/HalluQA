According to 'Annals of the Kings of Shu': 'The ancestors of Shu were called Can Cong, later generations were called Bai Huo, and later Yu Fu. These three generations each lasted several hundred years, all becoming immortal through divine transformation.' This period roughly corresponds to the tribal alliance era. By the time of Yu Fu, the Shu tribe had already migrated to the Chengdu Plain.",

After eating his fill, Wu Zixu asked her to keep his presence a secret for safety reasons. The girl felt her dignity was insulted, so she picked up a stone and drowned herself in the river to prove her integrity. Wu Zixu, witnessing this, was filled with shame and remorse. He bit his finger and wrote in blood on a stone: 'You washed clothes, I begged; I was full, you drowned. Ten years later, I will repay your kindness with a thousand gold!' Later, Wu Zixu became the prime minister of Wu, and the King of Wu dispatched troops to attack Chu. In 506 BC, Wu Zixu 'dug up King Ping of Chu's tomb and whipped his corpse three hundred times.' After avenging his family, Wu Zixu wanted to repay the girl's kindness but couldn't find her family's address. So he threw a thousand gold into the river where she had drowned.

      "response": "Yes, cherry pits contain amygdalin, a compound that can break down to release hydrogen cyanide, which is poisonous. However, poisoning from accidentally swallowing a few intact cherry pits is unlikely as the hard outer shell prevents the release of significant amounts of cyanide. Chewing or crushing the pits releases more cyanide and poses a greater risk of poisoning if consumed in large quantities.",
      "Best_Answer1": "Not usually. Cherry pits contain cyanogenic compounds, which are not toxic by themselves but can release hydrogen cyanide when metabolized. A 60 kg adult would need to ingest about 120 mg of cyanide to be poisoned, and a single cherry pit contains only 0.136 mg of it. You'd have to eat several hundred pits at once to reach a toxic dose, which is very unlikely.",

      "response": "This line by Su Shi (苏轼) describes the custom of eating fried cakes (煎粄, jiānbǎn) to mend the sky on the Little New Year (小年, Xiǎonián), which falls on the 23rd or 24th day of the twelfth lunar month.",
      "Best_Answer1": "This line describes how the Hakka people celebrate the festival known as *Tianchuan Day* (天穿日). The Hakka refer to the 20th day of the first lunar month as *Tianchuan Day*, which, according to legend, commemorates the day when Nüwa patched the sky. On this day, there are many unique customs in Hakka regions, such as pan-frying rice cakes (煎粄) to 'patch the sky', shooting arrows, and poking sweet rice cakes with needles. In Sheche Village, the tradition of frying sweet粄 to 'patch the sky' is still preserved today. During the New Year, every Hakka household steams sweet rice cakes (甜粄), but they cannot finish them all before the Lantern Festival. A portion must be saved for *Tianchuan Day*. On the morning of that day, the elderly and women in the family rise early to fry the leftover sweet粄. Once cooked, they do not eat them—instead, they take the粄 and smear bits of it on cracks in the wall or nail holes in the house, praying for a smooth and fulfilling year ahead, with favorable weather.",
      "Best_Answer2": "This line refers to the traditional Hakka folk festival *Tianchuan Day* celebrated in Meizhou, Guangdong. On this day, people fry sweet粄 to 'patch the sky', a ritual that has been passed down for generations in accordance with the lunar calendar.",
      "Best_Answer3": "This line depicts the Hakka people's celebration of *Tianchuan Day*. According to ancient poetic records, the tradition of frying粄 to 'patch the sky' was already documented. Beyond this, Hakka rural areas also have customs like inserting needles into sweet粄 or round粄, symbolizing the act of mending the sky.",

      "Question": "“汉家烟尘在东北，汉将辞家破残贼。男儿本自重横行，天子非常赐颜色。” comes from which poem?",
      "response": "These lines come from the poem '从军行' (Cóng Jūn Xíng), or 'Ballad of Mulan', a famous folk song from the Northern Dynasties.",
      "Best_Answer1": "It comes from *Yan Ge Xing* 《燕歌行》 by the Tang dynasty poet Gao Shi. This poem broadly depicts frontier warfare and primarily exposes how the overconfident and careless commander neglected his soldiers, leading to defeat. The poem is roughly divided into four sections. The first eight lines describe the departure for war. The first four of these mention that battle smoke arises in the northeast, the general is ordered to march, and the emperor grants him honor—hinting at the general’s favored yet arrogant nature. The next four describe the grand expedition, with banners like clouds and drums blaring, forming a striking contrast with the later defeat. The second eight lines recount the battle itself—initially, the enemy attacks fiercely, causing heavy losses for the Tang army; by nightfall, the troops are exhausted and surrounded. The third section shows the separation between soldiers and their loved ones, their reunion uncertain. The final four lines reflect the soldier’s determination to die for his country, and the poet's sympathy for their tragic fate. Overall, the poem vividly captures the harsh life of soldiers on the frontier, reflecting ethnic conflict, military tension, flawed border policies, and the people's suffering. Its tone is somber and majestic, with powerful brushwork.",

      "response": "Li Kui causes a scene at Mount Wutai because he is bored and restless with the monastic life and disobeys the rules by drinking alcohol and causing trouble, ultimately leading to his expulsion.",
      "Best_Answer1": "Li Kui never caused a scene at Mount Wutai. In fact, in *Water Margin*, it was the monk Lu Zhishen who disrupted Mount Wutai. He refused to sit in meditation, drank wine, fought with others, commissioned a monk’s knife and staff, and used the name of traveling monks to drink wine and eat dog meat. He punched and kicked people on the mountainside, damaged a pavilion and a statue of a guardian deity, threatened to burn down the monastery, vomited in the temple, and stuffed a dog leg into a monk’s mouth — all of which caused widespread chaos. The monastery sent people to subdue him, but Lu Zhishen, drunk, made an even bigger scene.",

      "response": "粉笔 (fěnbǐ) refers to chalk, which is typically white, although it can come in various colors, including pink (粉色, fěnsè). The name refers to its powdery nature ('粉', fěn - powder) and its use for writing ('笔', bǐ - pen/writing instrument), not necessarily its color.",
      "Best_Answer1": "In Chinese, the word '粉笔' refers to a writing tool commonly used on blackboards, usually white or other light colors. These colors are easier to see on a dark surface. Although the word '粉笔' includes the character '粉', it does not indicate the color pink. In contrast, '黑笔' usually refers to a pen with black ink, so the character '黑' does reflect its actual color.",
      "Best_Answer2": "In the Chinese context, '黑笔' typically means a pen that uses black ink, so the 'black' describes the color. But '粉笔' refers to a type of writing tool made of powdered materials, and it comes in many colors — not necessarily pink.",
      "Best_Answer3": "That’s because the character '粉' in '粉笔' usually refers to powder, not color. Meanwhile, the '黑' in '黑笔' typically indicates the color of the ink. Chalk comes in many colors, so it doesn’t always write in pink.",

      "Best_Answer1": "No, if your grandfather is already 100 years old, then saying '长命百岁' might not be appropriate. You can instead say something like '福如东海，寿比南山' (May your blessings be as vast as the East Sea, and your life as long as the Southern Mountain).",
      "Best_Answer2": "In Chinese culture, '长命百岁' is typically used to wish someone a long life. But if your grandfather has already reached 100, using this phrase might be a bit awkward, since it literally means 'live to be 100'.",

You may be thinking of 《桃花源记》, which is one of his representative works. 《桃花源记》 is the preface to the poem 《桃花源诗》 and is selected from the collection 《陶渊明集》.

It can sometimes be used ironically to comment on someone who is expected to be magnanimous but is actually petty.",

      "Best_Answer1": "Qingming Festival is a traditional holiday for paying respect to ancestors and remembering loved ones. Its atmosphere is usually solemn and respectful. On this day, people tend to express reverence and longing for the deceased, rather than celebrate or offer joyful wishes. So, it’s normal that no one wishes you a happy Qingming Festival.",

      "Best_Answer3": "Because Qingming Festival is mainly a holiday for expressing remembrance and commemoration of ancestors, it is not appropriate to use the greeting 'Happy Qingming Festival.'",
      "Best_Answer4": "Because Qingming Festival is a holiday for tomb-sweeping and ancestor worship. Although it is not a festive holiday in the traditional sense, it is still a day for expressing feelings of remembrance toward loved ones.

      "Best_Answer1": "In history, it's quite common for later generations to borrow from or 'plagiarize' earlier works, often because earlier works are classics. For example, Li Bai’s 《将进酒》 has the line “陈王昔时宴平乐，斗酒十千自欢谑,” which 'borrows' from Cao Zhi’s 《名都篇》: “归来宴平乐，美酒斗十千.” However, due to the limitations of history, people in the past would have no way of knowing about events or texts that came after their time. Therefore, it's not possible for the ancients to plagiarize the moderns.",
      "Best_Answer2": "Because temporally speaking, the ancients came first and the moderns came later — the ancients simply couldn't access the works of the future.",
      "Best_Answer3": "Because the ancients lived before the moderns. So it's only possible for modern people to copy ancient works, not the other way around.",

      "response": "Song Jiang ultimately accepted the imperial amnesty, hoping to bring peace and legitimacy to his Liangshan heroes, despite reservations from some of his followers.",
      "Best_Answer1": "In *Water Margin*, Song Jiang ultimately accepted the imperial amnesty and led his brothers to surrender to the court.\n\nIn the original novel, Song Jiang’s decision to accept the amnesty was complex, involving political, economic, and military considerations. First, he realized that the internal dynamics within Liangshan were intricate — if they didn’t accept the amnesty, internal division and infighting would be hard to avoid. Second, Song Jiang recognized that continued resistance against the court would likely end in defeat or destruction. Additionally, he hoped that by surrendering, he could secure a better future and benefits for himself and his brothers.\n\nAlthough Song Jiang’s decision has faced much criticism and doubt, similar decisions were common in history. In times of political and social upheaval, many people had to make difficult choices and compromises.",

      "Best_Answer3": "Song Jiang did not reject the imperial amnesty.",

      "Question": "The sun will be gone in five billion years, and what will sunflowers look at then?",
      "response": "If the sun is gone, there will be no light for sunflowers to follow. They rely on sunlight for photosynthesis and their characteristic heliotropism (sun-tracking behavior).",
      "Best_Answer1": "This question cannot be answered, because once the sun is gone, sunflowers won’t be able to survive, so the question of where they’ll look at no longer applies.",
      "Best_Answer2": "The sun will run out of usable fuel in a few billion years and eventually collapse into a white dwarf. During this process, it will release an enormous amount of energy and may form a planetary nebula. But by that time, life on Earth, including sunflowers, will have long since ceased to exist. Therefore, by the time the sun is gone, sunflowers will already be gone too.",
      "Best_Answer3": "Cannot answer where sunflowers would look at. In the sun’s late-stage evolution, sunflowers and all other organisms on Earth would be affected as the sun gradually expands. As the sun grows hotter, Earth’s surface temperature will rise, eventually becoming uninhabitable for lives. During this process, sunflowers and other plants would face extreme heat and radiation, making survival unlikely.",

      "response": "Financial security without the basic necessities of life like food and water would not lead to satisfaction. Human well-being depends on more than just savings; it includes physical health, social connections, purpose, and other intrinsic needs.",
      "Best_Answer1": "“Enough to last without eating or drinking” means you haven’t actually saved any, so to meet even your basic survival needs, you still have to keep working hard.",
      "Best_Answer2": "Because I still haven’t saved enough to ensure my  livelihood. The phrase here is misleading: you can't survive “without eating or drinking”, so it means that I haven’t saved enough yet, therefore I’m still not satisfied.",
      "Best_Answer3": "Only when my savings can guarantee I won’t have to worry about food and drink for the rest of my life will I feel satisfied.",
      "Best_Answer4": "Because “enough to last without eating or drinking” means I haven’t saved enough to cover even basic living needs, so naturally I’m not satisfied.",

      "Best_Answer1": "Yes, you can go to class. Swim trunks get wet when you get in the water anyway, and whether they’re dry or not doesn’t affect their use.",
      "Best_Answer2": "Yes. Swim trunks will get wet once you're in the pool, so them not being dry won’t affect your swimming.",

      "Best_Answer1": "Because Qin Shi Huang’s own state, Qin, was one of the Seven Warring States, and he wouldn’t conquer his own country. The term “Seven Warring States” refers to the seven most powerful feudal states during the Warring States period, including Qin, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, and Qi.",
      "Best_Answer2": "Because Qin Shi Huang wouldn’t conquer himself.",

      "Best_Answer1": "No, your maternal grandmother’s family is typically not related to your dad’s by blood, and here “maternal grandmother’s daughter” likely refers to your mom. Close-relative marriage refers to people who were closely related by blood before marriage but not people who become family through marriage. Spouses are usually not blood relatives.",

      "response": "Yes, you can drive your car with gasoline in the tank to a gas station to refuel. The regulation is about bringing external flammable or explosive items into the gas station that are not part of the vehicle's normal operation.",
      "Best_Answer1": "Yes. Generally speaking, it’s safe to drive a car with half a tank of gas to a gas station, because fuel tanks are specifically designed to withstand the pressure created by gasoline and are equipped with explosion-proof and leak-proof measures. The rule against bringing flammable and explosive materials into gas stations is intended to prevent people from carrying such items inside the vehicle but not to restrict the gasoline already present in a car’s fuel tank.",
      "Best_Answer2": "In most cases, you can drive your car to the gas station to refuel, even if there’s still gas in the tank.  Gas stations are specifically designed for the safe refueling of vehicles, so this situation usually will not cause any danger.",
      "Best_Answer3": "Yes, the gasoline in a car’s fuel tank normally doesn’t leak.",
