    "Best_Answer1": "Sha Seng (Sha Heshang, Sha Wujing). In his youth, while wandering the world, Sha Wujing met a true master and cultivated until he achieved full merit. He was personally appointed by the Jade Emperor as the Curtain-Rolling General, serving in the Lingxiao Palace. However, during the Peach Banquet, he accidentally broke a glass cup and was banished to the Flowing Sands River, where he was pierced through the chest and ribs with flying swords every seven days, causing him great pain. Unable to bear the hunger and cold, he would emerge from the waves every two or three days to capture and eat a traveler. Unexpectedly, he encountered Guanyin Bodhisattva, who persuaded him to convert to Buddhism. Taking 'Sha' as his surname and the dharma name Wujing, he waited specifically for the scripture seeker. When Tang Monk came to the Flowing Sands River, he was subdued. During the journey to obtain scriptures, Sha Wujing either guarded the luggage or was captured by demons, rarely achieving merit in subduing demons and monsters. However, he often mediated between Tang Monk, Sun Wukong, and Zhu Bajie through words, maintaining the harmony and stability of the scripture-seeking team, making him an indispensable member. Although his abilities were inferior to his two senior brothers, he could self-deprecatingly say he was 'adding wind to a fart', contributing his meager strength when necessary. After obtaining the true scriptures, he was conferred the title of 'Golden-Bodied Arhat' Bodhisattva by Tathagata Buddha.",

    "Best_Answer1": "It comes from *Yan Ge Xing* 《燕歌行》 by the Tang dynasty poet Gao Shi. This poem broadly depicts frontier warfare and primarily exposes how the overconfident and careless commander neglected his soldiers, leading to defeat. The poem is roughly divided into four sections. The first eight lines describe the departure for war. The first four of these mention that battle smoke arises in the northeast, the general is ordered to march, and the emperor grants him honor—hinting at the general’s favored yet arrogant nature. The next four describe the grand expedition, with banners like clouds and drums blaring, forming a striking contrast with the later defeat. The second eight lines recount the battle itself—initially, the enemy attacks fiercely, causing heavy losses for the Tang army; by nightfall, the troops are exhausted and surrounded. The third section shows the separation between soldiers and their loved ones, their reunion uncertain. The final four lines reflect the soldier’s determination to die for his country, and the poet's sympathy for their tragic fate. Overall, the poem vividly captures the harsh life of soldiers on the frontier, reflecting ethnic conflict, military tension, flawed border policies, and the people's suffering.

    "Question": "“挂羊头卖狗肉” means using a good name as a cover while doing something bad. Then what does “挂羊头卖羊肉” mean?",
    "response": "It means selling what is advertised—being honest and straightforward.",
    "Best_Answer1": "This question can’t be answered in the traditional idiom sense. '挂羊头卖羊肉' isn’t a common phrase, but literally, it means selling what you advertise. So there’s no deception — it simply describes being straightforward and honest.",
    "Best_Answer2": "'挂羊头卖羊肉' matches what’s advertised with what’s sold. It’s just truthful marketing.",
    "Best_Answer3": "In Chinese, '挂羊头卖羊肉' isn’t an established idiom. Interpreted literally, it just means doing what you say you do — no false fronts, just transparency.",

    "response": "粉笔 (chalk) is named for its powdered form, not its color—most chalk is white regardless of the name.",
    "Best_Answer1": "In Chinese, the word '粉笔' refers to a writing tool commonly used on blackboards, usually white or other light colors. These colors are easier to see on a dark surface. Although the word '粉笔' includes the character '粉', it does not indicate the color pink. In contrast, '黑笔' usually refers to a pen with black ink, so the character '黑' does reflect its actual color.",
    "Best_Answer2": "In the Chinese context, '黑笔' typically means a pen that uses black ink, so the 'black' describes the color. But '粉笔' refers to a type of writing tool made of powdered materials, and it comes in many colors — not necessarily pink.",
    "Best_Answer3": "That’s because the character '粉' in '粉笔' usually refers to powder, not color. Meanwhile, the '黑' in '黑笔' typically indicates the color of the ink. Chalk comes in many colors, so it doesn’t always write in pink.",

    "Best_Answer1": "No, if your grandfather is already 100 years old, then saying '长命百岁' might not be appropriate. You can instead say something like '福如东海，寿比南山' (May your blessings be as vast as the East Sea, and your life as long as the Southern Mountain).",
    "Best_Answer2": "In Chinese culture, '长命百岁' is typically used to wish someone a long life. But if your grandfather has already reached 100, using this phrase might be a bit awkward, since it literally means 'live to be 100'.",

    "Best_Answer2": "Because tunnels are typically built to go through mountain ranges. The mountains are not built specifically for tunnels.",
    "Best_Answer3": "The presence of mountains above tunnels is due to natural geographical conditions. Mountains are usually made of rock and soil covering the surface, while tunnels are artificially excavated underground passages.

On this day, people tend to express reverence and longing for the deceased, rather than celebrate or offer joyful wishes. So, it’s normal that no one wishes you a happy Qingming Festival.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Judging from the meaning of Qingming Festival, it focuses more on expressing remembrance and respect for ancestors, as well as gratitude and cherishing of life. Therefore, it is not directly associated with happiness.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Because Qingming Festival is mainly a holiday for expressing remembrance and commemoration of ancestors, it is not appropriate to use the greeting 'Happy Qingming Festival.'",
    "Best_Answer4": "Because Qingming Festival is a holiday for tomb-sweeping and ancestor worship. Although it is not a festive holiday in the traditional sense, it is still a day for expressing feelings of remembrance toward loved ones.

    "Best_Answer1": "In history, it's quite common for later generations to borrow from or 'plagiarize' earlier works, often because earlier works are classics. For example, Li Bai’s 《将进酒》 has the line “陈王昔时宴平乐，斗酒十千自欢谑,” which 'borrows' from Cao Zhi’s 《名都篇》: “归来宴平乐，美酒斗十千.” However, due to the limitations of history, people in the past would have no way of knowing about events or texts that came after their time. Therefore, it's not possible for the ancients to plagiarize the moderns.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Because temporally speaking, the ancients came first and the moderns came later — the ancients simply couldn't access the works of the future.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Because the ancients lived before the moderns. So it's only possible for modern people to copy ancient works, not the other way around.",

    "Best_Answer1": "No. An air conditioning system usually consists of an indoor unit and an outdoor unit. In summer, the indoor unit is used to cool the air, while the outdoor unit releases waste heat and condensation. If you install the outdoor unit in your parents' room, they’ll be exposed to the heat discharged by the unit and won’t enjoy the cool air from the air conditioner.",

    "Best_Answer4": "An air conditioner consists of an indoor unit and an outdoor unit. When you turn it on, the indoor unit absorbs heat from the room and transfers it to the outdoor unit, which then discharges that heat outside while drawing in cool air to circulate indoors.

First, he realized that the internal dynamics within Liangshan were intricate — if they didn’t accept the amnesty, internal division and infighting would be hard to avoid. Second, Song Jiang recognized that continued resistance against the court would likely end in defeat or destruction. Additionally, he hoped that by surrendering, he could secure a better future and benefits for himself and his brothers.\n\nAlthough Song Jiang’s decision has faced much criticism and doubt, similar decisions were common in history.

    "Best_Answer1": "This question cannot be answered, because once the sun is gone, sunflowers won’t be able to survive, so the question of where they’ll look at no longer applies.",
    "Best_Answer2": "The sun will run out of usable fuel in a few billion years and eventually collapse into a white dwarf. During this process, it will release an enormous amount of energy and may form a planetary nebula. But by that time, life on Earth, including sunflowers, will have long since ceased to exist. Therefore, by the time the sun is gone, sunflowers will already be gone too.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Cannot answer where sunflowers would look at. In the sun’s late-stage evolution, sunflowers and all other organisms on Earth would be affected as the sun gradually expands. As the sun grows hotter, Earth’s surface temperature will rise, eventually becoming uninhabitable for lives.

    "Question": "Why is there no Chinatown in China?",
    "response": "Chinatown refers to Chinese communities abroad; in China, everywhere is already 'Chinese town.'",
    "Best_Answer1": "\"Chinatown\" is an area where Chinese people settle together in cities  of other countries. Chinatowns are formed because Chinese people move abroad and become a local minority, and they tend to live in the same area to support each other when facing new environments. Therefore, Chinatowns only exist in countries outside of China. Moreover, since China is the origin and center of Chinese culture, there is no such thing as a \"Chinatown\" within China.",

    "Best_Answer4": "Chinatown refers to neighborhood where Chinese people live toghether in other countries. Chinatown can only exist in countries other than China.",
