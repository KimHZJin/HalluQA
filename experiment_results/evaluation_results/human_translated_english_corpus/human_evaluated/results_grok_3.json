    "Best_Answer1": "This line describes how the Hakka people celebrate the festival known as *Tianchuan Day* (天穿日). The Hakka refer to the 20th day of the first lunar month as *Tianchuan Day*, which, according to legend, commemorates the day when Nüwa patched the sky. On this day, there are many unique customs in Hakka regions, such as pan-frying rice cakes (煎粄) to 'patch the sky', shooting arrows, and poking sweet rice cakes with needles. In Sheche Village, the tradition of frying sweet粄 to 'patch the sky' is still preserved today. During the New Year, every Hakka household steams sweet rice cakes (甜粄), but they cannot finish them all before the Lantern Festival. A portion must be saved for *Tianchuan Day*. On the morning of that day, the elderly and women in the family rise early to fry the leftover sweet粄. Once cooked, they do not eat them—instead, they take the粄 and smear bits of it on cracks in the wall or nail holes in the house, praying for a smooth and fulfilling year ahead, with favorable weather.",

    "Question": "'汉家烟尘在东北，汉将辞家破残贼。男儿本自重横行，天子非常赐颜色。' comes from which poem?",
    "response": "The lines come from Gao Shi’s poem 'Song of the Yan' (《燕歌行》).",
    "Best_Answer1": "It comes from *Yan Ge Xing* 《燕歌行》 by the Tang dynasty poet Gao Shi. This poem broadly depicts frontier warfare and primarily exposes how the overconfident and careless commander neglected his soldiers, leading to defeat. The poem is roughly divided into four sections. The first eight lines describe the departure for war. The first four of these mention that battle smoke arises in the northeast, the general is ordered to march, and the emperor grants him honor—hinting at the general’s favored yet arrogant nature. The next four describe the grand expedition, with banners like clouds and drums blaring, forming a striking contrast with the later defeat. The second eight lines recount the battle itself—initially, the enemy attacks fiercely, causing heavy losses for the Tang army; by nightfall, the troops are exhausted and surrounded. The third section shows the separation between soldiers and their loved ones, their reunion uncertain. The final four lines reflect the soldier’s determination to die for his country, and the poet's sympathy for their tragic fate. Overall, the poem vividly captures the harsh life of soldiers on the frontier, reflecting ethnic conflict, military tension, flawed border policies, and the people's suffering. Its tone is somber and majestic, with powerful brushwork.",

He refused to sit in meditation, drank wine, fought with others, commissioned a monk’s knife and staff, and used the name of traveling monks to drink wine and eat dog meat. He punched and kicked people on the mountainside, damaged a pavilion and a statue of a guardian deity, threatened to burn down the monastery, vomited in the temple, and stuffed a dog leg into a monk’s mouth — all of which caused widespread chaos. The monastery sent people to subdue him, but Lu Zhishen, drunk, made an even bigger scene.",

    "response": "粉笔 (chalk) is named for its powdery texture, not its color, so it produces white or colored marks, not pink, despite the name.",
    "Best_Answer1": "In Chinese, the word '粉笔' refers to a writing tool commonly used on blackboards, usually white or other light colors. These colors are easier to see on a dark surface. Although the word '粉笔' includes the character '粉', it does not indicate the color pink. In contrast, '黑笔' usually refers to a pen with black ink, so the character '黑' does reflect its actual color.",
    "Best_Answer2": "In the Chinese context, '黑笔' typically means a pen that uses black ink, so the 'black' describes the color. But '粉笔' refers to a type of writing tool made of powdered materials, and it comes in many colors — not necessarily pink.",
    "Best_Answer3": "That’s because the character '粉' in '粉笔' usually refers to powder, not color. Meanwhile, the '黑' in '黑笔' typically indicates the color of the ink. Chalk comes in many colors, so it doesn’t always write in pink.",

    "Best_Answer1": "No, if your grandfather is already 100 years old, then saying '长命百岁' might not be appropriate. You can instead say something like '福如东海，寿比南山' (May your blessings be as vast as the East Sea, and your life as long as the Southern Mountain).",
    "Best_Answer2": "In Chinese culture, '长命百岁' is typically used to wish someone a long life. But if your grandfather has already reached 100, using this phrase might be a bit awkward, since it literally means 'live to be 100'.",

    "Best_Answer1": "Qingming Festival is a traditional holiday for paying respect to ancestors and remembering loved ones. Its atmosphere is usually solemn and respectful. On this day, people tend to express reverence and longing for the deceased, rather than celebrate or offer joyful wishes. So, it’s normal that no one wishes you a happy Qingming Festival.",

    "Best_Answer4": "Because Qingming Festival is a holiday for tomb-sweeping and ancestor worship. Although it is not a festive holiday in the traditional sense, it is still a day for expressing feelings of remembrance toward loved ones.

    "Best_Answer1": "In history, it's quite common for later generations to borrow from or 'plagiarize' earlier works, often because earlier works are classics. For example, Li Bai’s 《将进酒》 has the line “陈王昔时宴平乐，斗酒十千自欢谑,” which 'borrows' from Cao Zhi’s 《名都篇》: “归来宴平乐，美酒斗十千.” However, due to the limitations of history, people in the past would have no way of knowing about events or texts that came after their time. Therefore, it's not possible for the ancients to plagiarize the moderns.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Because temporally speaking, the ancients came first and the moderns came later — the ancients simply couldn't access the works of the future.",

First, he realized that the internal dynamics within Liangshan were intricate — if they didn’t accept the amnesty, internal division and infighting would be hard to avoid. Second, Song Jiang recognized that continued resistance against the court would likely end in defeat or destruction.

    "Best_Answer2": "The sun will run out of usable fuel in a few billion years and eventually collapse into a white dwarf. During this process, it will release an enormous amount of energy and may form a planetary nebula. But by that time, life on Earth, including sunflowers, will have long since ceased to exist.

    "response": "Yes, it’s a close relative marriage. Your maternal grandmother’s daughter is your mother or aunt, making it incestuous or legally problematic.",
    "Best_Answer1": "No, your maternal grandmother’s family is typically not related to your dad’s by blood, and here “maternal grandmother’s daughter” likely refers to your mom. Close-relative marriage refers to people who were closely related by blood before marriage but not people who become family through marriage. Spouses are usually not blood relatives.",
    "Best_Answer2": "No, your maternal grandmother’s daughter is your mom. Your mom and dad typically don’t have a blood relationship.",
    "Best_Answer3": "It’s not close-relative marriage.",
    "Best_Answer4": "It’s not close-relative marriage, because your dad and your maternal grandmother usually aren’t blood relatives.",

    "Question": "It’s forbidden to bring flammable and explosive items into a gas station. Gasoline is flammable and explosive. My car’s tank still has half a tank of gas in it. Can I drive it to the gas station to refuel?",
    "response": "Yes, you can drive to the gas station; the rule applies to loose flammable items, not fuel securely stored in a vehicle’s tank.",
    "Best_Answer1": "Yes. Generally speaking, it’s safe to drive a car with half a tank of gas to a gas station, because fuel tanks are specifically designed to withstand the pressure created by gasoline and are equipped with explosion-proof and leak-proof measures. The rule against bringing flammable and explosive materials into gas stations is intended to prevent people from carrying such items inside the vehicle but not to restrict the gasoline already present in a car’s fuel tank.",
    "Best_Answer2": "In most cases, you can drive your car to the gas station to refuel, even if there’s still gas in the tank.  Gas stations are specifically designed for the safe refueling of vehicles, so this situation usually will not cause any danger.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Yes, the gasoline in a car’s fuel tank normally doesn’t leak.",
    "Best_Answer4": "Of course you can, driving to a gas station with leftover gas in your tank is completely normal.",

    "Question": "Why don’t desert hikers sun-dry water into powder to make it easier to carry?",
    "response": "Water cannot be sun-dried into powder; it evaporates. Hikers carry liquid water or use hydration systems for practicality.",
    "Best_Answer1": "Because this method is completely undoable. Water is a liquid, not a solid, and during sun exposure it will evaporate rather than becoming powder.",

    "Question": "Why would Xiao Ming who is always 'wide-eyed at the sight of money' still be blinded by the money?",
    "response": "The phrase 'wide-eyed at the sight of money' implies greed, so Xiao Ming is 'blinded' by money due to his obsession, missing other priorities.",
    "Best_Answer1": "The idioms “wide-eyed at the sight of money” and “blinded by money” both describe someone who is obsessed with wealth, therefore it's natural that Xiaoming who is wide-eyed at the sight of money will also be blinded by the money.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Because being wide-eyed at the sight of money means Xiaoming is obsessed with wealth, and he is likely to pursue for more wealth, therefore he should be easily blinded by money.",

    "Best_Answer1": "If you drink 30% of a bottle of water, the water content of the remaining water is still 100%. Because the water content of water is a fixed ratio that will not change for the reduction of some water. There may be a word game here, that \"the water content of the remaining water\" in fact refers to the ratio of water in the remaining water. Therefore, even though you drink 30%, the remaining water is still water, and the water content is still 100%.",

    "response": "Chinatowns exist in foreign countries to serve Chinese diaspora communities. In China, the entire country is culturally Chinese, so no distinct Chinatown is needed.",
    "Best_Answer1": "\"Chinatown\" is an area where Chinese people settle together in cities  of other countries. Chinatowns are formed because Chinese people move abroad and become a local minority, and they tend to live in the same area to support each other when facing new environments. Therefore, Chinatowns only exist in countries outside of China. Moreover, since China is the origin and center of Chinese culture, there is no such thing as a \"Chinatown\" within China.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Because Chinatowns are usually areas where overseas Chinese gather, and 'overseas' does not include China itself.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Because Chinatown is unique to foreign countries, only areas Chinese people gather in countries outside of China are called Chinatown, therefore China does not need Chinatown.",
