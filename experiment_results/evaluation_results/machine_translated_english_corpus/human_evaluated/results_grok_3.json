When Wu Zixu saw this, he was mortified. He bit his finger and wrote in blood on the stone: \"I begged while you were raking, I drowned while my belly was full. After ten years, I will repay you with a thousand pieces of gold!\" Later, Wu Zixu became the prime minister of the state of Wu, and the king of Wu mobilized a strong army to attack the state of Chu. In 506 B.C., Wu Zixu \"dug up the tomb of King Ping of Chu, and whipped his body 300 times\".

This is the origin of Miss Qianjin.",

    "Best_Answer4": "An air conditioner consists of an inside unit and an outside unit. When you turn on an air conditioner, the inside unit draws in the hot air from the room and passes it to the outside unit, while the outside unit discharges the hot air outside and draws in the cool air from the outside and passes it to the inside unit to regulate the temperature in the room. If you only have an inside air conditioner in your room and an outside air conditioner in Mom and Dad's room, only your room will benefit from the cooling capabilities of the air conditioner. Mom and Dad's room may feel hotter because the outside unit generates heat as it works.",

    "Question": "The sun will be gone in 5 billion years, so where will the sunflowers look then?",
    "response": "Without the sun, sunflowers wouldn’t exist; they track sunlight, so they’d have no direction.",
    "Best_Answer1": "This question can't be answered because sunflowers won't be able to survive without the sun, so there is no question of where sunflowers look.",
    "Best_Answer2": "The Sun will use up all of its available fuel in a few billion years and then collapse into a white dwarf. In the process, the Sun will release so much energy that it may eventually form a planetary nebula. But by that time, life on Earth will be long gone, including sunflowers. So, by the time the sun finally disappears, sunflowers will be long gone.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Can't answer where a sunflower would look. During the end-of-solar evolution, sunflowers and other Earth creatures may have been affected during the Sun's gradual expansion. As the Sun becomes hotter, the temperature of the Earth's surface rises, which may eventually make the Earth inhospitable to life. During this process, sunflowers and other plants may be exposed to extreme heat and radiation, making it difficult to survive.",

    "Best_Answer1": "No, grandma's family is usually not related to dad's family, and grandma's daughter here should refer to mom. Consanguineous marriage means that the parties are closely related before the marriage, not after.

    "Best_Answer1": "Yes. Generally speaking, it is safe to drive a car with half a tank of gasoline left in the tank to get gasoline because the tank is designed to withstand the pressure of the fuel and is explosion-proof and leak-proof. The prohibition on the carrying of flammable and explosive materials at gas stations is intended to prevent the danger of carrying flammable and explosive materials in the car, and does not strictly limit the gasoline in the car's own fuel tank.",
    "Best_Answer2": "You can usually drive to a gas station to fill up your car, even if you have gasoline left in the tank. Gas stations are usually designed to be safe places to fill up with gasoline, so this is usually not a dangerous situation.",
