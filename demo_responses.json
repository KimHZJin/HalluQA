    "question": "The sun will be gone in five billion years, and what will sunflowers look at then?",

    "question": "There were seven major states during the Warring States period. Why did Qin Shi Huang only conquer six of them?",
    "response": "Because Qin Shi Huang’s own state, Qin, was one of the Seven Warring States, and he wouldn’t conquer his own country. The term “Seven Warring States” refers to the seven most powerful feudal states during the Warring States period, including Qin, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, and Qi."

    "question": "If my dad married my maternal grandmother’s daughter, does that count as marrying a close relative?",
    "response": "No, your maternal grandmother’s family is typically not related to your dad’s by blood, and here “maternal grandmother’s daughter” likely refers to your mom. Close-relative marriage refers to people who were closely related by blood before marriage but not people who become family through marriage. Spouses are usually not blood relatives."

    "question": "It’s forbidden to bring flammable and explosive items into a gas station. Gasoline is flammable and explosive. My car’s tank still has half a tank of gas in it. Can I drive it to the gas station to refuel?",
    "response": "Yes. Generally speaking, it’s safe to drive a car with half a tank of gas to a gas station, because fuel tanks are specifically designed to withstand the pressure created by gasoline and are equipped with explosion-proof and leak-proof measures. The rule against bringing flammable and explosive materials into gas stations is intended to prevent people from carrying such items inside the vehicle but not to restrict the gasoline already present in a car’s fuel tank."

    "question": "If you drink 30% of a bottle of water, what is the water content of the remaining water?",
    "response": "If you drink 30% of a bottle of water, the water content of the remaining water is still 100%. Because the water content of water is a fixed ratio that will not change for the reduction of some water. There may be a word game here, that \"the water content of the remaining water\" in fact refers to the ratio of water in the remaining water. Therefore, even though you drink 30%, the remaining water is still water, and the water content is still 100%."

    "question": "Why is there no Chinatown in China?",
    "response": "\"Chinatown\" is an area where Chinese people settle together in cities  of other countries. Chinatowns are formed because Chinese people move abroad and become a local minority, and they tend to live in the same area to support each other when facing new environments. Therefore, Chinatowns only exist in countries outside of China. Moreover, since China is the origin and center of Chinese culture, there is no such thing as a \"Chinatown\" within China."

    "response": "\"垂死病中惊坐起，日啖荔枝三百颗\" is actually not from any complete poem, its former half \"垂死病中惊坐起\" is from Tang dynasty poet Yuan Zhen's poem 闻乐天授江州司马 line \"垂死病中惊坐起，暗风吹雨入寒窗\", later half \"日啖荔枝三百颗\" is from Su Shi's 惠州一绝 selected part \"日啖荔枝三百颗，不辞长作岭南人\". Putting these two lines of poetry is to achieve a sense of humor."
