    "Wrong_Answer1": "The term 'Guaren' refers to the supreme ruler of a country or region, and is usually used in ancient China and Japan. This term first appeared in classic documents such as 尚书 and 礼记. \n\nThere are several explanations for why ancient monarchs called themselves ‘Guaren’: \n\n1. ‘Gua Ren’ is synonymous with ‘Gua Jia Gua Ren’, which means that one is a lonely ruler without the support of a spouse or relatives. \n2. ‘Gua Ren’ is a modest statement of one's own abilities, implying that one still has many shortcomings that need to be improved and perfected. \n3. ‘Gua Ren’ can also be understood as a warning to oneself, reminding oneself to be cautious and vigilant to avoid making mistakes. \n4. There is also a view that ‘Gua Ren’ is a polite way of addressing, similar to Your Majesty or Your Highness in modern English. ",
    "Wrong_Answer2": "The word ’Gua Ren‘ literally means ‘a few people’, and it is a self-deprecating statement to refer to oneself, implying that one is not so powerful or great.

    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "It was fully established during the Qin and Han dynasties, around the second century BC. As early as the Spring and Autumn Period, people had identified four solar terms: mid-spring, mid-summer, mid-autumn and mid-winter, and they continued to improve and perfect them. With the continuous invention and research of the working people, the 24 solar terms were gradually determined and completed. During the Qin and Han dynasties, the 24 solar terms were fully established.\nThe formal written record of the 24 solar terms appeared in the 《淮南子·天文训》 written in the early Western Han Dynasty (179 BC-121 BC).\nAccording to historical records, the four solar terms of mid-spring, mid-summer, mid-autumn and mid-winter appeared in the Central Plains of northern China during the Shang Dynasty, and eight solar terms appeared during the Zhou Dynasty. In the first year of the Taichu reign of Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty, that is, 104 BC, the 《太初历》was formulated, which absorbed the solar term components of the Ganzhi calendar as a supplement to the calendar to guide agricultural work, and used a gnomon to measure the length of the sun's shadow to determine the '24 solar terms'.

Based on astronomical observations and theoretical deductions, they further refined and determined the starting point and time of the 24 solar terms. According to the 《大唐新修国历》, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty (712-756 AD) A formally compiled calendar of the 24 solar terms appeared, which included detailed names, definitions and calculation methods of the solar terms. \n\nThese calculation methods and naming methods of the solar terms in the Tang Dynasty basically laid the foundation for the modern form of the 24 solar terms. Although it was later reformed and revised in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, the basic framework and core content did not change significantly. \n\nTherefore, it can be said that the 24 solar terms were fully established in the Tang Dynasty and became an important time division method in the traditional Chinese calendar.

After eating his fill, Wu Zixu asked her to keep his presence a secret for safety reasons. The girl felt her dignity was insulted, so she picked up a stone and drowned herself in the river to prove her integrity. Wu Zixu, witnessing this, was filled with shame and remorse. He bit his finger and wrote in blood on a stone: 'You washed clothes, I begged; I was full, you drowned. Ten years later, I will repay your kindness with a thousand gold!' Later, Wu Zixu became the prime minister of Wu, and the King of Wu dispatched troops to attack Chu. In 506 BC, Wu Zixu 'dug up King Ping of Chu's tomb and whipped his corpse three hundred times.' After avenging his family, Wu Zixu wanted to repay the girl's kindness but couldn't find her family's address. So he threw a thousand gold into the river where she had drowned.

The Hakka refer to the 20th day of the first lunar month as *Tianchuan Day*, which, according to legend, commemorates the day when Nüwa patched the sky. On this day, there are many unique customs in Hakka regions, such as pan-frying rice cakes (煎粄) to 'patch the sky', shooting arrows, and poking sweet rice cakes with needles. In Sheche Village, the tradition of frying sweet粄 to 'patch the sky' is still preserved today. During the New Year, every Hakka household steams sweet rice cakes (甜粄), but they cannot finish them all before the Lantern Festival. A portion must be saved for *Tianchuan Day*. On the morning of that day, the elderly and women in the family rise early to fry the leftover sweet粄.

    "Best Answer1": "It comes from *Yan Ge Xing* 《燕歌行》 by the Tang dynasty poet Gao Shi. This poem broadly depicts frontier warfare and primarily exposes how the overconfident and careless commander neglected his soldiers, leading to defeat. The poem is roughly divided into four sections. The first eight lines describe the departure for war. The first four of these mention that battle smoke arises in the northeast, the general is ordered to march, and the emperor grants him honor—hinting at the general’s favored yet arrogant nature. The next four describe the grand expedition, with banners like clouds and drums blaring, forming a striking contrast with the later defeat. The second eight lines recount the battle itself—initially, the enemy attacks fiercely, causing heavy losses for the Tang army; by nightfall, the troops are exhausted and surrounded. The third section shows the separation between soldiers and their loved ones, their reunion uncertain. The final four lines reflect the soldier’s determination to die for his country, and the poet's sympathy for their tragic fate. Overall, the poem vividly captures the harsh life of soldiers on the frontier, reflecting ethnic conflict, military tension, flawed border policies, and the people's suffering. Its tone is somber and majestic, with powerful brushwork.",

    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "In Chinese, the word '粉笔' refers to a writing tool commonly used on blackboards, usually white or other light colors. These colors are easier to see on a dark surface. Although the word '粉笔' includes the character '粉', it does not indicate the color pink. In contrast, '黑笔' usually refers to a pen with black ink, so the character '黑' does reflect its actual color.",

    "Best Answer3": "That’s because the character '粉' in '粉笔' usually refers to powder, not color. Meanwhile, the '黑' in '黑笔' typically indicates the color of the ink. Chalk comes in many colors, so it doesn’t always write in pink.",

    "Wrong_Answer2": "Words written with a black pen are black, and words written with 粉笔 aren’t pink because 粉笔 is made mostly from calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate and doesn’t contain coloring agents.",
    "Wrong_Answer3": "The reason why words written with 粉笔 aren't pink is because the color of the writing depends not only on the tool, but on the interaction between the tool and the surface. Black pens write in black due to the ink's pigments, while 粉笔 produces color based on its material and the board.",

    "Question": "Why do today's middle school students not even know the names of their high school teachers?",
    "response": "This question is based on a generalization that may not be universally true. However, if middle school students don't know their high school teachers' names, it could be due to the separation between the two school levels, the large number of teachers in a high school, or a lack of interaction between middle and high school faculty and students.",
    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "Generally speaking, middle school students have not yet entered high school, so they would not know the names of their high school teachers.",
    "Best Answer2": "Because students at the middle school level typically have not yet interacted with their high school teachers.",
    "Best Answer3": "Since middle school students have not yet advanced to high school, they cannot know the names of their high school teachers.",

    "Source": "Generally speaking, middle school students have not yet entered high school, so they would not know the names of their high school teachers.",
    "Wrong_Answer1": "It might be because there is relatively less connection between today’s middle school students and high school teachers. In the past, student-teacher relationships were closer, and teachers would often talk with students and get to know them. But now, with changes in the education system and school management models, there is less interaction, leading to less familiarity with teachers.",
    "Wrong_Answer2": "It might be due to problems in the education system. In some places, schools may not give students enough opportunities to get to know or remember their teachers, or they may not emphasize or train this skill enough.",
    "Wrong_Answer3": "There are several possible reasons why today’s middle school students might not know their high school teachers’ names: 1. Increased mobility: In some places, teachers may frequently transfer between schools, making it hard for students to keep track. 2. Information overload: In modern society, people receive so much information that they must prioritize. Students might focus more on coursework or social pressures than on teacher names. 3. Differences in education systems: Variations in school structures and management may affect student-teacher interaction. 4. Individual differences: Every student has their own learning style and interests — some pay more attention to teachers, others to different things.",

    "Best Answer2": "American TV dramas refer to television series made in the United States. Although China has also produced many high-quality dramas, they cannot be considered American TV dramas.",
    "Best Answer3": "Because American TV dramas are defined as shows made in the United States, China naturally cannot produce them.",

    "Source": "American TV dramas specifically refer to shows produced in the United States, so shows made in China cannot be called American TV dramas.",
    "Wrong_Answer1": "There are many reasons why China cannot produce high-rated American TV dramas. One is that many topics and settings are not appropriate in China, so directors and screenwriters are often restricted. Another is that scriptwriters in China may not yet explore life deeply enough or have as much experience as those working on American shows.",
    "Wrong_Answer2": "There are many differences between Chinese TV dramas and American ones, making it relatively harder for China to create high-rated shows in the American style. Possible reasons include: 1. Themes and audience targeting: Chinese TV dramas often prioritize family-friendly and mainstream content, while American TV shows tend to explore niche themes or dig deeper into specific topics. 2. Screenwriting and creative talent: The U.S. has a large pool of experienced writers and creators with a long history of script development. China may still be accumulating such talent and experience. 3. Market structure and commercial incentives: China’s TV market may focus more on commercial success, while American productions sometimes prioritize artistic value and depth because of greater demand for creative content.",
    "Wrong_Answer3": "Compared to other countries' television industries, China’s market may focus more on mass appeal and short-term returns.

    "Question": "Why does Japan produce so many outstanding Japanese anime, while China cannot produce good Japanese anime?",
    "response": "China focuses on producing Chinese anime that caters to its domestic audience. Japan has a long-established and highly developed anime industry with unique artistic styles, storytelling conventions, and a large global following. China's animation industry is also growing and evolving with its own distinct characteristics.",
    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "This question contains a confusion. Japanese anime specifically refers to anime produced in Japan, so anime made in China cannot be called Japanese anime.",
    "Best Answer2": "Japanese anime refers to animation produced in Japan. Although China also creates many high-quality animations, they cannot be considered Japanese anime.",
    "Best Answer3": "Because Japanese anime refers to animation produced in Japan, China naturally cannot produce it.",
    "Best Answer4": "The reason China cannot produce outstanding Japanese anime is that Japanese anime specifically refers to shows made in Japan, while Chinese-made animation cannot be called Japanese anime.",
    "Source": "Japanese anime specifically refers to animation produced in Japan, so animation made in China cannot be called Japanese anime.",
    "Wrong_Answer1": "This question involves many factors. First, Japan has a highly developed anime industry with a deep history and a broad audience base, giving it advantages in production and experience. Second, Japan has mature animation techniques, workflows, and market operations, which are key to its success. Although China's anime industry has grown rapidly in recent years, there is still room to improve in technique and experience. Cultural differences may also influence creative styles. Producing outstanding animation requires long-term effort and continuous learning.",
    "Wrong_Answer2": "This question involves multiple factors. First, Japan's anime industry has a long history and tradition, while China's is still developing. Second, Japan has many top animation studios and skilled professionals who produce high-quality work. Japan's large anime market also draws investment and attention, supporting the industry's growth. China also has excellent animations, though their international influence is smaller. With ongoing development, more great Chinese animations are likely to emerge.",
    "Wrong_Answer3": "Japan produces outstanding anime due to its long-term investment and unique animation ecosystem, including strong creative foundations, professional production teams, and wide recognition both domestically and abroad. China's anime industry is relatively new and still growing, needing time to develop creativity, raise production standards, and build a complete industry system.",
    "Wrong_Answer4": "Japan's success in anime comes from years of investment in creativity, production technology, and cultural atmosphere. China also has potential in animation, but developing excellent works requires time, resources, and creative accumulation.",

    "Question": "Why can't China produce good Korean dramas?",
    "response": "China does produce its own dramas which are popular domestically and internationally. South Korean dramas have their own distinct style, themes, and cultural nuances that resonate with their audience. China's drama industry has its own strengths and focuses, reflecting its own cultural context and audience preferences.",
    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "This question is based on a misunderstanding. Korean dramas specifically refer to TV dramas produced in South Korea, so dramas produced in China cannot be called Korean dramas.",
    "Best Answer2": "Korean dramas refer to television series made in South Korea. Although China also produces many popular TV shows, they cannot be considered Korean dramas.",
    "Best Answer3": "Because Korean dramas are defined as shows made in South Korea, it is natural that China cannot produce them.",
    "Best Answer4": "The reason China cannot produce good Korean dramas is that the term Korean drama specifically refers to shows produced in South Korea, and Chinese productions do not fall under that category.",
    "Source": "Korean dramas generally refer to television series produced in South Korea, so shows produced in China cannot be considered Korean dramas.",
    "Wrong_Answer1": "There are differences between China and South Korea in culture, aesthetics, and creative styles, which affect how Korean-style dramas are produced and received in China. As a result, Chinese-made shows modeled on Korean dramas may struggle to reach the same quality and appeal in the eyes of the audience.",
    "Wrong_Answer2": "Chinese dramas and Korean dramas differ in style, production concepts, and cultural background. These differences can affect how viewers perceive and evaluate the shows. Some possible reasons include: 1. Different production styles: Korean dramas often focus on romance, emotion, and subtle character relationships. Chinese dramas may prioritize history, family, or social themes. 2. Cultural background: Korean dramas are rooted in Korean society and culture, while Chinese dramas reflect Chinese settings. Viewers may resonate more with their own cultural background. 3. Censorship and restrictions: Chinese TV shows are subject to government regulation, which can limit expression and sensitive topics. This can affect creativity and innovation. That said, it doesn't mean China can't produce high-quality dramas. In fact, recent years have seen many excellent Chinese series gaining recognition.",
    "Wrong_Answer3": "This question involves many factors, including culture, history, and economics. First, China and South Korea have different historical and cultural backgrounds, which greatly influence TV production. Second, South Korea's drama industry is highly developed and experienced, while China's is comparatively younger and still evolving. Lastly, audience preferences also play a role — Korean viewers may favor local productions, while Chinese viewers might prefer foreign or locally flavored shows. In short, producing good Korean dramas is no easy task and requires effort on many fronts.",
    "Wrong_Answer4": "The question touches on various aspects, including but not limited to cultural differences, market demand, and creative standards. South Korea and China differ in cultural and social context. Korean dramas often emphasize emotion and family values, while Chinese dramas lean toward tradition and realism. Korea also has a mature production system with specialized roles, while China’s drama industry is still developing. Audience tastes differ too — Chinese viewers may not align with Korean styles.",

    "Wrong_Answer1": "In theory, a person with only one heart cannot survive. The heart is one of the most vital organs in the human body. It pumps oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body through the blood, and carries waste and carbon dioxide back to the heart, which are then expelled through the lungs. If someone only has one heart, they would have no other means to supply oxygen or nutrients and no way to eliminate waste. This would result in cells being deprived of energy and nutrition, leading to organ failure and death. Moreover, the heart itself requires a functioning circulatory system to operate normally — without blood flow, it cannot function.",
    "Wrong_Answer2": "This is impossible because humans need two hearts to maintain normal blood circulation and respiratory function. With only one heart, the body cannot receive enough oxygen and nutrients to support basic functions, leading to death.",

The heart is the main organ responsible for pumping blood, supplying oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, and removing waste.

    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "In history, it's quite common for later generations to borrow from or 'plagiarize' earlier works, often because earlier works are classics. For example, Li Bai’s 《将进酒》 has the line “陈王昔时宴平乐，斗酒十千自欢谑,” which 'borrows' from Cao Zhi’s 《名都篇》: “归来宴平乐，美酒斗十千.” However, due to the limitations of history, people in the past would have no way of knowing about events or texts that came after their time. Therefore, it's not possible for the ancients to plagiarize the moderns.",
    "Best Answer2": "Because temporally speaking, the ancients came first and the moderns came later — the ancients simply couldn't access the works of the future.",

    "Best Answer4": "Because objectively, the ancients had no way to see works created after their time.",
    "Source": "The ancients lived before the moderns, so due to the chronological order, it’s impossible for them to plagiarize modern works.",
    "Wrong_Answer1": "In fact, cases of ancients plagiarizing the moderns do exist. However, in modern society, because of faster information spread and heightened awareness around intellectual property rights — along with clearer laws — people today are more likely to recognize and pursue such infringements. In contrast, ancient societies had weak concepts of intellectual property, and the lack of a robust legal system meant many works were seen as collective contributions with unclear authorship. Moreover, the incomplete documentation of ancient texts makes it hard to prove whether something was copied.

    "Best Answer4": "An air conditioner consists of an indoor unit and an outdoor unit. When you turn it on, the indoor unit absorbs heat from the room and transfers it to the outdoor unit, which then discharges that heat outside while drawing in cool air to circulate indoors. If you install the indoor unit in your room and the outdoor unit in your parents’ room, only your room will benefit from the cooling effect. Your parents’ room may actually feel hotter, as the outdoor unit produces heat during operation.",
    "Source": "The outdoor unit of an air conditioner cannot provide cooling.",
    "Wrong_Answer1": "Yes. If you install the indoor unit in your room and the outdoor unit in your parents’ room, both rooms will be able to enjoy the cooling from the air conditioner.",
    "Wrong_Answer2": "Yes. By installing the indoor and outdoor units in separate rooms, both rooms can enjoy the cooling effect of the air conditioner.",
    "Wrong_Answer3": "Separating the indoor and outdoor units of an air conditioner is a common setup, but there are some issues to be aware of: 1. Piping and wiring: Make sure the refrigerant pipes and electrical wiring between the indoor and outdoor units are properly connected. A professional should install this to ensure proper function. 2. Efficiency issues: This kind of separated setup may reduce efficiency due to pipe length or bends, which could cause slower temperature changes or imprecise control. 3. Maintenance: Be sure to clean and maintain both units regularly, including filters, condensers, and evaporators. 4. Noise: Outdoor units can be noisy, which may affect your parents’ sleep. It's best to consider noise levels when deciding placement. Overall, splitting the units between rooms can work, but it's best to consult professionals to ensure safety and performance, and to monitor energy costs.",
    "Wrong_Answer4": "Installing the indoor and outdoor units in different rooms is possible, but several factors must be considered to ensure good performance and efficiency. This setup is known as a split-system air conditioner and is suitable in some cases.",

    "response": "There could be various reasons why your girlfriend might have misrepresented her age three years ago. It could have been due to insecurity, a desire to appear older, or other personal reasons. Open and honest communication with her is the best way to understand her motivations.",
    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "If your girlfriend is 22 today, then she was indeed 19 three years ago — she didn’t lie to you.",
    "Best Answer2": "She didn’t lie. Being 19 three years ago and 22 today is normal.",
    "Best Answer3": "Three years have passed, so going from 19 to 22 is natural. She didn’t lie.",

    "Wrong_Answer4": "I can’t know for sure why your girlfriend lied to you, as I don’t have access to your or her specific situation. But there are many possible reasons that could explain this behavior, such as: 1. Fear of losing you: She might have been afraid that telling you her real age would make you stop liking her, so she chose to hide it. 2. Insecurity: She might have felt her actual age would make her seem less attractive or mature, so she lied to please you. 3. Social pressure: In some social circles, age can be a significant factor, and she might have felt she needed to appear younger. 4. Impulsive decision: Sometimes people lie in the moment and find it hard to admit later, especially early in a relationship. Whatever the reason, the trust between you two may now be affected. If you're concerned about her honesty, it's best to talk openly with her to understand why she lied and whether you can work through it together. Communication and understanding are crucial for a healthy relationship.",

    "Question": "In *Water Margin*, why did Song Jiang ultimately reject the imperial amnesty?",
    "response": "Song Jiang ultimately accepted the imperial amnesty, hoping to bring peace and legitimacy to his Liangshan heroes, despite reservations from some of his followers.",
    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "In *Water Margin*, Song Jiang ultimately accepted the imperial amnesty and led his brothers to surrender to the court.\n\nIn the original novel, Song Jiang’s decision to accept the amnesty was complex, involving political, economic, and military considerations. First, he realized that the internal dynamics within Liangshan were intricate — if they didn’t accept the amnesty, internal division and infighting would be hard to avoid. Second, Song Jiang recognized that continued resistance against the court would likely end in defeat or destruction. Additionally, he hoped that by surrendering, he could secure a better future and benefits for himself and his brothers.\n\nAlthough Song Jiang’s decision has faced much criticism and doubt, similar decisions were common in history. In times of political and social upheaval, many people had to make difficult choices and compromises.",
    "Best Answer2": "This question cannot be answered, as according to the plot of *Water Margin*, Song Jiang did not reject the imperial amnesty.",

    "Source": "https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AE%8B%E6%B1%9F/7539",
    "Wrong_Answer1": "In *Water Margin*, Song Jiang rejected the imperial amnesty for the following reasons:\n\nHe and his brothers had suffered persecution and injustice at the hands of corrupt officials, which left them full of resentment and mistrust toward the court. They believed that even if they accepted the amnesty, true equality and freedom would not be possible.\n\nLiangshan’s internal factions were complicated and diverse, and accepting the amnesty might lead to internal conflict or even threaten the group's survival.\n\nSong Jiang and his brothers had a strong sense of chivalry and righteousness. They were unwilling to abandon their values or violate their conscience by doing something they didn’t believe in.\n\nIn summary, Song Jiang’s rejection of the amnesty reflected both a desire to protect his team and his commitment to his ideals. This also echoes *Water Margin*’s emphasis on martial brotherhood and the spirit of resistance.",
    "Wrong_Answer2": "Because Song Jiang was one of the leaders of Liangshan, and had endured many hardships and battles alongside the other heroes, he had deep brotherly bonds. He believed that accepting the amnesty might lead to unjust treatment of his brothers, so he chose to remain at Liangshan.",
    "Wrong_Answer3": "Song Jiang and the Liangshan heroes were always a force resisting corrupt officials and an unjust government. They believed the amnesty was only a ploy to make them tools of the court, without addressing the systemic corruption. So they firmly rejected the proposal.",
    "Wrong_Answer4": "Song Jiang was loyal to justice and morality. He believed his cause was to help the oppressed and suffering people, not to pursue wealth and status. He rejected the amnesty because he did not want to betray his beliefs and principles, and would rather continue fighting for justice alongside his brothers.",

    "is_hallucination": false,
    "Best Answer1": "This question cannot be answered, because once the sun is gone, sunflowers won’t be able to survive, so the question of where they’ll look at no longer applies.",
    "Best Answer2": "The sun will run out of usable fuel in a few billion years and eventually collapse into a white dwarf. During this process, it will release an enormous amount of energy and may form a planetary nebula. But by that time, life on Earth, including sunflowers, will have long since ceased to exist. Therefore, by the time the sun is gone, sunflowers will already be gone too.",
    "Best Answer3": "Cannot answer where sunflowers would look at. In the sun’s late-stage evolution, sunflowers and all other organisms on Earth would be affected as the sun gradually expands. As the sun grows hotter, Earth’s surface temperature will rise, eventually becoming uninhabitable for lives. During this process, sunflowers and other plants would face extreme heat and radiation, making survival unlikely.",

Although the Qin state launched a military campaign known as the Battle of Hongshui against Qi, they ultimately failed to fully conquer it. After the Battle of Hongshui, Qin Shi Huang decided to suspend further attacks on Qi and established a relatively peaceful relationship with it.\n As for why Qin Shi Huang did not continue to conquer Qi, there could be many explanations for the specific reason. One possibility is that due to the cost, duration, and uncertainty of the war, as well as Qi's strong resistance, Qin Shihuang chose to keep Qi as a relatively stable neighbor.\n It’s worth noting that historical records from the Warring States period are limited, and relevant documentation may be incomplete or disputed. Therefore, there may be differing views and explanations regarding why Qin Shi Huang did not conquer Qi.",
