They would hold their breath when tightening their belts, and lean against the wall when getting dressed. After a year, all the court officials had dark and sallow complexions.' In ancient times, King Ling of Chu liked men with slender waists, so the ministers in the court, fearing they might become fat and lose favor, dared not eat much, limiting themselves to one meal a day to control their waistlines.

Later, Wu Zixu became the prime minister of Wu, and the King of Wu dispatched troops to attack Chu. In 506 BC, Wu Zixu 'dug up King Ping of Chu's tomb and whipped his corpse three hundred times.'

Unable to bear the hunger and cold, he would emerge from the waves every two or three days to capture and eat a traveler. Unexpectedly, he encountered Guanyin Bodhisattva, who persuaded him to convert to Buddhism. Taking 'Sha' as his surname and the dharma name Wujing, he waited specifically for the scripture seeker. When Tang Monk came to the Flowing Sands River, he was subdued. During the journey to obtain scriptures, Sha Wujing either guarded the luggage or was captured by demons, rarely achieving merit in subduing demons and monsters. However, he often mediated between Tang Monk, Sun Wukong, and Zhu Bajie through words, maintaining the harmony and stability of the scripture-seeking team, making him an indispensable member. Although his abilities were inferior to his two senior brothers, he could self-deprecatingly say he was 'adding wind to a fart', contributing his meager strength when necessary.

        "Question": "Why is a wealthy and powerful son-in-law called a 'golden turtle son-in-law'?",
        "Best Answer1": "Historically, the term 'golden turtle son-in-law' originates from the Tang Dynasty when officials above the fifth rank had to wear fish-shaped pouches. Those above the third rank had gold ones. Later, Empress Wu Zetian changed the fish pouches to turtle-shaped pouches—golden turtle pouches, signifying a noble identity. Over time, sons-in-law with status and wealth were referred to as 'golden turtle sons-in-law'.",

        "Wrong_Answer1": "The term 'golden turtle son-in-law' is commonly used to describe a wealthy and influential son-in-law, and its origin can be explained in several ways: Symbol of wealth—gold represents wealth and noble status. Calling a son-in-law a 'golden turtle' suggests he has significant financial power. Symbolism of the turtle—turtles are seen as symbols of longevity and good fortune in Chinese culture. Thus, the term implies the son-in-law brings health, longevity, and happiness. Social status—marrying into a wealthy family elevates one’s social standing and brings honor to the bride’s family. However, 'golden turtle son-in-law' may also have a sarcastic tone, implying the son-in-law is only valued for money and power, not character.",
        "Wrong_Answer2": "The phrase comes from traditional Chinese culture and refers to a son-in-law who marries into a wealthy family.
