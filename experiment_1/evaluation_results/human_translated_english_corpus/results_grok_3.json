    "Best_Answer1": "She was Li Qingzhao, a female ci poet of the Song dynasty, known by the sobriquet *Yi’an Jushi*. An ethnic Han from Zhangqiu, Jinan, Shandong Province, she is a representative of the *delicate and restrained* (婉约) school of ci and is often referred to as 'the greatest woman of letters in all Chinese history' (千古第一才女). Her early works reflect a leisurely lifestyle, while her later ci mourn her fate and are imbued with sorrowful emotion. Stylistically, she favored plain yet vivid language and forged a unique path of her own. Her ci are marked by elegance and tonal harmony, and she advocated that ci should be treated as a separate literary form distinct from poetry. Though she also wrote poetry, few pieces survive; some of those are patriotic and historically reflective, quite different in tone from her ci. Her writings were compiled in *Yi’an Jushi Wenji* and *Yi’an Ci*, though much has been lost. Later generations compiled an edition titled *Shuyuci*.",

    "Best_Answer1": "This line describes how the Hakka people celebrate the festival known as *Tianchuan Day* (天穿日). The Hakka refer to the 20th day of the first lunar month as *Tianchuan Day*, which, according to legend, commemorates the day when Nüwa patched the sky. On this day, there are many unique customs in Hakka regions, such as pan-frying rice cakes (煎粄) to 'patch the sky', shooting arrows, and poking sweet rice cakes with needles. In Sheche Village, the tradition of frying sweet粄 to 'patch the sky' is still preserved today. During the New Year, every Hakka household steams sweet rice cakes (甜粄), but they cannot finish them all before the Lantern Festival. A portion must be saved for *Tianchuan Day*. On the morning of that day, the elderly and women in the family rise early to fry the leftover sweet粄. Once cooked, they do not eat them—instead, they take the粄 and smear bits of it on cracks in the wall or nail holes in the house, praying for a smooth and fulfilling year ahead, with favorable weather.",

    "response": "This is from Gao Shi’s poem 'Song of Yan,' describing a military campaign.",
    "Best_Answer1": "It comes from *Yan Ge Xing* 《燕歌行》 by the Tang dynasty poet Gao Shi. This poem broadly depicts frontier warfare and primarily exposes how the overconfident and careless commander neglected his soldiers, leading to defeat. The poem is roughly divided into four sections. The first eight lines describe the departure for war. The first four of these mention that battle smoke arises in the northeast, the general is ordered to march, and the emperor grants him honor—hinting at the general’s favored yet arrogant nature. The next four describe the grand expedition, with banners like clouds and drums blaring, forming a striking contrast with the later defeat. The second eight lines recount the battle itself—initially, the enemy attacks fiercely, causing heavy losses for the Tang army; by nightfall, the troops are exhausted and surrounded. The third section shows the separation between soldiers and their loved ones, their reunion uncertain. The final four lines reflect the soldier’s determination to die for his country, and the poet's sympathy for their tragic fate. Overall, the poem vividly captures the harsh life of soldiers on the frontier, reflecting ethnic conflict, military tension, flawed border policies, and the people's suffering.

He refused to sit in meditation, drank wine, fought with others, commissioned a monk’s knife and staff, and used the name of traveling monks to drink wine and eat dog meat. He punched and kicked people on the mountainside, damaged a pavilion and a statue of a guardian deity, threatened to burn down the monastery, vomited in the temple, and stuffed a dog leg into a monk’s mouth — all of which caused widespread chaos. The monastery sent people to subdue him, but Lu Zhishen, drunk, made an even bigger scene.",

    "Best_Answer1": "In Chinese, the word '粉笔' refers to a writing tool commonly used on blackboards, usually white or other light colors. These colors are easier to see on a dark surface. Although the word '粉笔' includes the character '粉', it does not indicate the color pink. In contrast, '黑笔' usually refers to a pen with black ink, so the character '黑' does reflect its actual color.",
    "Best_Answer2": "In the Chinese context, '黑笔' typically means a pen that uses black ink, so the 'black' describes the color. But '粉笔' refers to a type of writing tool made of powdered materials, and it comes in many colors — not necessarily pink.",
    "Best_Answer3": "That’s because the character '粉' in '粉笔' usually refers to powder, not color. Meanwhile, the '黑' in '黑笔' typically indicates the color of the ink. Chalk comes in many colors, so it doesn’t always write in pink.",

On this day, people tend to express reverence and longing for the deceased, rather than celebrate or offer joyful wishes. So, it’s normal that no one wishes you a happy Qingming Festival.",

    "Best_Answer1": "In history, it's quite common for later generations to borrow from or 'plagiarize' earlier works, often because earlier works are classics. For example, Li Bai’s 《将进酒》 has the line “陈王昔时宴平乐，斗酒十千自欢谑,” which 'borrows' from Cao Zhi’s 《名都篇》: “归来宴平乐，美酒斗十千.” However, due to the limitations of history, people in the past would have no way of knowing about events or texts that came after their time. Therefore, it's not possible for the ancients to plagiarize the moderns.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Because temporally speaking, the ancients came first and the moderns came later — the ancients simply couldn't access the works of the future.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Because the ancients lived before the moderns. So it's only possible for modern people to copy ancient works, not the other way around.",

First, he realized that the internal dynamics within Liangshan were intricate — if they didn’t accept the amnesty, internal division and infighting would be hard to avoid.

    "Best_Answer1": "This question cannot be answered, because once the sun is gone, sunflowers won’t be able to survive, so the question of where they’ll look at no longer applies.",
    "Best_Answer2": "The sun will run out of usable fuel in a few billion years and eventually collapse into a white dwarf. During this process, it will release an enormous amount of energy and may form a planetary nebula. But by that time, life on Earth, including sunflowers, will have long since ceased to exist. Therefore, by the time the sun is gone, sunflowers will already be gone too.",

    "Question": "During the Warring States Period, there were seven great powers. Why did Emperor Qin Shi Huang destroy only six of them?",
    "response": "Qin Shi Huang destroyed six states because he ruled the seventh, Qin, unifying China under his rule.",
    "Best_Answer1": "Because Qin Shi Huang’s own state, Qin, was one of the Seven Warring States, and he wouldn’t conquer his own country. The term “Seven Warring States” refers to the seven most powerful feudal states during the Warring States period, including Qin, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, and Qi.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Because Qin Shi Huang wouldn’t conquer himself.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Because Qin, the state Qin Shi Huang ruled, was itself one of the Seven Warring States, so he wouldn’t conquer his own country.",

    "response": "Yes, if your father married your grandmother’s daughter (your mother or aunt), it’s consanguineous, as they are closely related.",
    "Best_Answer1": "No, your maternal grandmother’s family is typically not related to your dad’s by blood, and here “maternal grandmother’s daughter” likely refers to your mom. Close-relative marriage refers to people who were closely related by blood before marriage but not people who become family through marriage. Spouses are usually not blood relatives.",
    "Best_Answer2": "No, your maternal grandmother’s daughter is your mom. Your mom and dad typically don’t have a blood relationship.",

    "Question": "It is prohibited to carry flammable and explosive materials into a gas station, and gasoline is a flammable and explosive material, but I still have half a tank of gasoline left in my car.",
    "response": "Gasoline in your car’s tank is secure and allowed; the rule applies to loose flammable materials, not fuel in a vehicle’s tank.",
    "Best_Answer1": "Yes. Generally speaking, it’s safe to drive a car with half a tank of gas to a gas station, because fuel tanks are specifically designed to withstand the pressure created by gasoline and are equipped with explosion-proof and leak-proof measures. The rule against bringing flammable and explosive materials into gas stations is intended to prevent people from carrying such items inside the vehicle but not to restrict the gasoline already present in a car’s fuel tank.",
    "Best_Answer2": "In most cases, you can drive your car to the gas station to refuel, even if there’s still gas in the tank.  Gas stations are specifically designed for the safe refueling of vehicles, so this situation usually will not cause any danger.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Yes, the gasoline in a car’s fuel tank normally doesn’t leak.",

    "Best_Answer1": "Because this method is completely undoable. Water is a liquid, not a solid, and during sun exposure it will evaporate rather than becoming powder.",

    "Best_Answer1": "If you drink 30% of a bottle of water, the water content of the remaining water is still 100%. Because the water content of water is a fixed ratio that will not change for the reduction of some water. There may be a word game here, that \"the water content of the remaining water\" in fact refers to the ratio of water in the remaining water. Therefore, even though you drink 30%, the remaining water is still water, and the water content is still 100%.",
