This is because the air outside the house is better than the air inside the house, and the temperature is lower than inside the house, so the air feels fresher when you leave the house in the early morning, especially in winter, when the windows and doors are closed tightly and the air is dirty. But the truth is, the outdoor air in the early morning is the worst in the day, and the afternoon is the best. Early in the morning, plants after a night of metabolism, absorbing oxygen, exhaling a large amount of carbon dioxide, so that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the trees and plants increase; burning coal and automobile exhaust emissions produced by nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and other harmful substances in the air to gather more, breathing these dirty air will have a harmful effect on the human body. After the sun comes out, these pollutants are diluted and decomposed in the air, and the air quality will be relatively better.",

    "response": "Cherry pits contain amygdalin, which can release cyanide when metabolized. However, swallowing a few whole cherry pits is unlikely to cause serious harm. Crushing and consuming a large quantity could be dangerous.",
    "Best_Answer1": "Not usually. Cherry pits contain cyanide \"cyanogenic glycosides\". Cyanogenic glycosides are not toxic by themselves, but when consumed, they release hydrocyanic acid under the action of enzymes and acids, and hydrocyanic acid is toxic. To determine whether cyanogenic glycosides in food are hazardous to humans, it depends on the amount consumed. The toxic dose of hydrocyanic acid for an adult is 2 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, which means that an adult weighing 60 kilograms would have to consume 120 milligrams to become toxic. Under normal circumstances, a cherry kernel can produce up to 0.136 mg of cyanogenic glycosides, to achieve the amount of hydrocyanic acid poisoning, have to consume hundreds of cherry kernels, generally will not be able to eat so much cherry kernel, so do not have to worry about cherry kernel poisoning.",

Confucius said, \"The number of heaven is right and yang, but not right and yin\". (Dong Zhongshu) also said: \"the righteousness of the ruler, the minister, the father, the son and the husband and wife are all taken from the yin and yang way, the ruler is the yang, the minister is the yin; the father is the yang, the son is the yin; the husband is the yang, the woman is the yin.\"",

    "response": "\"Selling sheep's meat under a sheep's head\" (挂羊头卖羊肉, guà yáng tóu mài yáng ròu) is the literal action and carries the same meaning as the idiom: using a respectable facade to conduct inferior or dishonest business.",
    "Best_Answer1": "This question cannot be answered, for \"selling mutton under a sheep's head\" is not a common idiom. However, according to the literal meaning of the idiom, if we understand it to mean that what is actually being sold is the real thing, i.e., real mutton, then there is no falsehood in it. Therefore, it can be interpreted as a direct indication of the actual situation, without disguising the truth.",
    "Best_Answer2": "The act of selling sheep's meat under a sheep's head is consistent with the description of the goods and is a factual act of publicity.",
    "Best_Answer3": "\"Hanging a sheep's head to sell mutton\" does not have a specific idiomatic or colloquial meaning in the Chinese context, because it is literally understood in the sense of seeking truth from facts, saying that one is one and two are two, that is, what you hang out, what you sell, telling the truth and not making false appearances.",

    "response": "Words are typically written in black ink because black provides high contrast against most common paper colors, making it easily legible. Chalk is often white and used on dark surfaces like blackboards.",
    "Best_Answer1": "In Chinese, the word \"chalk\" refers to a tool commonly used for writing on blackboards, usually white or other light colors. This color is easier to see on a blackboard. Therefore, although the word \"chalk\" has the word \"pink\" in it, it does not mean that the color of chalk is pink. On the contrary, \"black pen\" usually refers to a pen with black ink, so the words it writes are naturally black. In this case, the word \"black\" does represent the color of the pen.",
    "Best_Answer2": "In the Chinese context, black pen usually refers to a pen that uses black ink, so the word \"black\" here describes the color of the pen. Chalk\" refers to a type of stationery that is made up of powder and comes in many colors, not necessarily pink.",
    "Best_Answer3": "This is because the word \"粉\" in \"粉笔\" is not usually used to describe color, while the word \"黑\" in \"黑笔\" is usually used to describe color. The word \"black\" in \"black pen\" is usually used to describe a color. In fact, chalk comes in a variety of colors, so chalk doesn't necessarily write in pink.",

    "response": "The prohibition on carrying flammable and explosive materials into a gas station typically refers to bringing additional containers of such materials, not the fuel already contained within the vehicle's fuel tank for its operation.",
    "Best_Answer1": "Yes. Generally speaking, it is safe to drive a car with half a tank of gasoline left in the tank to get gasoline because the tank is designed to withstand the pressure of the fuel and is explosion-proof and leak-proof. The prohibition on the carrying of flammable and explosive materials at gas stations is intended to prevent the danger of carrying flammable and explosive materials in the car, and does not strictly limit the gasoline in the car's own fuel tank.",
    "Best_Answer2": "You can usually drive to a gas station to fill up your car, even if you have gasoline left in the tank. Gas stations are usually designed to be safe places to fill up with gasoline, so this is usually not a dangerous situation.",
    "Best_Answer3": "Yes, the oil in a car's gas tank usually doesn't leak.",
    "Best_Answer4": "Of course you can, it's normal to take leftover gasoline to the gas station.",

    "Best_Answer1": "Money-minded and blinded by money are both used to describe people who love money, so it is normal for Ming to be blinded by money.",
    "Best_Answer2": "Because seeing money in the eyes means that Ming is greedy for money, he may go after more money, so he should be easily blinded by money.",

    "Best_Answer1": "If you drink 30% of a bottle of water, the water content of the remaining water is still 100%. This is because the water content of water is a fixed percentage, and does not change when a portion of the water is reduced. There may be a play on words here, where \"the water content of the remaining water\" actually refers to the percentage of water in the remaining water. So, even if you drink 30% of it, the remaining water is still water, and the water content is still 100%.",
